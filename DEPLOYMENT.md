# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This document outlines the GitHub Pages deployment setup for the Option Analysis Dashboard.

## 🎯 Setup Complete

Your app is now fully configured for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Installed gh-pages package** for manual deployment
2. **Updated vite.config.ts** with correct base path (`/optionAnalysis/`)
3. **Added deployment scripts** to package.json:
   - `npm run deploy` - Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
   - `predeploy` hook automatically runs the build before deploying
4. **Created GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) for automatic deployment
5. **Added .nojekyll file** to public directory for proper asset serving
6. **Updated README.md** with deployment instructions
7. **Fixed TypeScript build errors** to ensure clean builds

### 📦 Build Status

✓ Production build successful!
- Total bundle size: ~210 KB
- Optimized with code splitting (vendor, utils chunks)
- Source maps enabled for debugging
- Assets properly configured for `/optionAnalysis/` base path

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The app will automatically deploy when you push to the `main` branch.

**First-time Setup:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/msrafi/optionAnalysis
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
4. That's it! 

**Usage:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Action will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Build the app
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Your app will be live at: https://msrafi.github.io/optionAnalysis/

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

Deploy manually using the gh-pages package:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the app (`npm run build`)
- Push the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages will serve from the `gh-pages` branch

**First-time Setup for Manual Deployment:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select **Branch**: `gh-pages`, **Folder**: `/ (root)`

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, verify your app at:
**https://msrafi.github.io/optionAnalysis/**

Check that:
- ✅ App loads correctly
- ✅ Assets (CSS, JS) load properly
- ✅ Data files are accessible
- ✅ All features work as expected

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already enabled):
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Choose deployment method (GitHub Actions recommended)

2. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor the deployment**:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Watch the deployment workflow run
   - Check for any errors

4. **Access your deployed app**:
   - Visit https://msrafi.github.io/optionAnalysis/
   - Share the link with your team!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Assets not loading
- Ensure the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
- Check that `.nojekyll` file exists in the `dist` folder after build

### 404 errors
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Check that the correct branch/source is selected

### Build failures
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds locally

### Local preview of production build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
