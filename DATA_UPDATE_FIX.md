# Permanent Fix for Data Update Issues

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing issues where new data files weren't being picked up because:
1. The `data-files.json` was only updated in `public/api/` directory
2. During builds, the dist directory needed its own copy of the file
3. No automatic update mechanism existed
4. Browser caching could prevent seeing new data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Data Files Scripts

Both `scripts/update-data-files.js` and `scripts/update-darkpool-data-files.js` now:
- Update `public/api/data-files.json` (for dev mode)
- Update `dist/api/data-files.json` (for production builds)
- Automatically sync changes when run

### 2. Prebuild Hook Added

Added `prebuild` script to `package.json` that automatically runs before every build:
```json
"prebuild": "npm run update-all-data"
```

This ensures that data files are always up-to-date before building.

### 3. Enhanced Vite Build Process

Updated `vite.config.ts` to:
- Copy CSV files from `data/` to `dist/data/` during build
- Copy API files from `public/api/` to `dist/api/` during build
- Provide console feedback about what's being copied

## How It Works Now

### Development Mode
1. Add new CSV files to the `data/` directory
2. Run `npm run update-all-data` (or it runs automatically on build)
3. The app will detect and load the new files

### Production Build
1. Add new CSV files to the `data/` directory
2. Run `npm run build`
3. The prebuild hook automatically updates data files
4. The build process copies everything to `dist/`

### Automatic Updates (Optional)
You can run in watch mode for automatic updates during development:
```bash
npm run watch-data          # For options data only
npm run watch-darkpool-data # For dark pool data only
```

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/update-data-files.js**
   - Now updates both `public/api/data-files.json` and `dist/api/data-files.json`
   - Includes watch mode for automatic syncing

2. **scripts/update-darkpool-data-files.js**
   - Same improvements as above for dark pool data

3. **package.json**
   - Added `prebuild` hook to auto-update data files before every build

4. **vite.config.ts**
   - Enhanced build plugin to copy both CSV files and API files to dist

## Usage

### For New Data Files

Simply add your CSV files to the `data/` directory following the naming convention:
- Options: `options_data_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.csv`
- Dark pool: `darkpool_data_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.csv`

Then run:
```bash
npm run update-all-data
```

Or if building for production:
```bash
npm run build  # The prebuild hook handles the update automatically
```

### For Development with Auto-Update

Run the watch mode:
```bash
npm run watch-data
```

This will automatically detect new files and update the API files in real-time.

## Cache Busting

If you're still seeing old data after adding new files:

1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Or use the "Clear All Caches" button in the application UI
3. Or run the update scripts explicitly:
   ```bash
   npm run update-all-data
   ```

## Benefits

✅ Automatic updates before every build  
✅ Works in both dev and production modes  
✅ No manual file copying needed  
✅ Proper sync between public/ and dist/ directories  
✅ Console feedback for debugging  
✅ Watch mode for development convenience  

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- A file watcher service that runs automatically in the background
- Git hooks to update data files on commit
- A webhook system for automated data ingestion
